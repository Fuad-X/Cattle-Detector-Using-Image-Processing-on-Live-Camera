In this project, I have achieved a system that can detect what kind of cattle a cattle is from live camera footage.

To run the system download the project and run the python app.py file which will open in the web browser.

If you want to run the model training file you have to download https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandkumarsahu09/cattle-breeds-dataset this dataset and add the files after making a directory named data in the project directory.


Happy Coding!!!!!!!!!
